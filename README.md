# MLH-Hackulator
This is a website prototype that firstly requires the user to signup with his/her gmail id and then allows them to enter their new year resolutions into the webite and keeps a track of them for them. It is also supposed to remind you of the tasks you've resolved to complete this year. The frequency of these reminders can be set by the user.
This was my entry to an hackathon hosted by MLH (Major League Hacking) on January 1 and 2 2022.
